## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


average of soil at different spatial resolutions at a county to compute county-level soil information

median of weather at different spatial resolutions at a county to scale up the county-level weather information

weekly data

Our model selected 202 robust features and 11 two-way interactions to predict the corn yield. Out of the 202 features, 155 were for weather, 37 for soil, and 10 for management.
